# Telecom Churn Predictor - Different Models Approach

This repository hosts the "Telecom Churn Predictor" project, which employs a diverse range of predictive models to tackle the challenge of customer churn in the telecommunications industry. High customer churn rates pose a significant threat to telecom companies. To address this issue, explored various machine learning models to predict which customers are at a high risk of churning.

## Dataset
The project leverages customer-level data from a prominent telecom firm in the Indian and Southeast Asian market. It encompasses the entire workflow, from data preparation and feature engineering to identifying high-value customers and implementing dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features and transform existing ones to improve model performance.
3. **Model Selection**: Explore various machine learning models such as logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting to predict churn.
4. **Handling Class Imbalance**: Implement techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights to address class imbalance.
5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Select appropriate evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
6. **Feature Importance**: Identify the most important predictor attributes using feature importance techniques.

## Results
Through a comprehensive approach involving multiple models, this project offers insights into strategies for reducing customer churn in the telecom industry. The results and findings can be used to implement data-driven solutions to enhance business outcomes and improve customer retention.

## Future Work
- Explore advanced machine learning techniques like deep learning or ensemble methods for improved churn prediction.
- Incorporate additional external datasets or features to enhance model performance.
- Implement real-time or proactive churn prevention strategies based on model predictions.

This repository is a valuable resource for understanding customer retention in the telecom industry and applying data-driven solutions to reduce customer churn.
