# Telecom-Churn-Predictor---Different-Models-Approach
This repository hosts the "Telecom Churn Predictor" project, which employs a diverse range of predictive models to tackle the challenge of customer churn in the telecommunications industry. High customer churn rates pose a significant threat to telecom companies. To address this issue, explored various machine learning models to predict which customers are at a high risk of churning.

The project leverages customer-level data from a prominent telecom firm in the Indian and Southeast Asian market. It encompasses the entire workflow, from data preparation and feature engineering to identifying high-value customers and implementing dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA. We employ different models to predict churn, handling class imbalance and selecting appropriate evaluation metrics.

In addition to churn prediction, the project aims to pinpoint the most important predictor attributes. Through a comprehensive approach involving multiple models, it offers insights into strategies for reducing customer churn. This repository is a valuable resource for understanding customer retention in the telecom industry and applying data-driven solutions to enhance business outcomes.
